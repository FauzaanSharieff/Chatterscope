# Chatterscope

Chatterscope is a project that is supposed to:
- Detect objects using a camera and describe using ChatGPT API
- Read out the description using Google Text-To-Speech API

Chatterscope is a project intended to teach me how to use software tools like:
- Git / Github
- API Handling
- Pipeline creation

Generative AI was used for the purposes of learning the required concepts, as well as 
guidance through the syntaxes and structure of the source code.
